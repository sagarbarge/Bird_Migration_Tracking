One fascinating area of research uses GPS to track movements of animals.
It is now possible to manufacturer a small GPS device that is solar charged,
so you don't need to change batteries, and use it to track flight patterns of birds.
The data for this case study comes from the LifeWatch INBO project.
Several data sets have been released as part of this project.
We will use a small data set that consists of migration data for three gulls named Eric, Nico, and Sanne.
The csv file contains eight columns, and includes variables
like latitude, longitude, altitude, and time stamps.
In this case study, we will first load the data,
visualize some simple flight trajectories,
track flight speed, learn about  daytime and much, much more.
